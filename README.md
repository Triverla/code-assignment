## Guide on how to run solutions

This README provides instructions for running the solutions to various coding problems included in this repository. \
For this project, we will assume that you are already in the project's directory.

### Problem 1
To run the solution for Problem 1, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal window.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the solution for Problem 1 using the following command:
```bash
cd problem-1
```
3. Run the solution script using Node.js by entering the following command:
```bash
node solution.js
```
4. Follow the prompts displayed in the terminal to provide input as required by the solution.
5. Once the solution has finished executing, review the output displayed in the terminal.


### Problem 2
To run the solution for Problem 2, follow these steps:
1. Open a terminal window.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the solution for Problem 2 using the following command:
```bash
cd problem-2
```
3. Run the solution script using Node.js by entering the following command:
```bash
node solution.js
```
This executes the script and creates an ``output.txt`` file in the problem 2 directory. \
This file contains the result of the solution.
